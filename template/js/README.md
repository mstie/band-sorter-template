# Song Catalog

The song catalog is defined in [./songlist.js](./songlist.js).

## Adding Albums and Songs

To add a new album, append the [./songlist.js](./songlist.js) and locate the RAW_ALBUMS array.

For each album, single, or cover add an object to the array. See the Field Name table below for more information about each field.

This is an example showing an album, single, and cover
```js
  {
    id: "hot-topic",
    title: "HOT TOPIC",
    year: 2026,
    cover: "img/albums/hotTopic.jpg",
    songs: [
        { title: "ICONIC" },
        { title: "Spicy Queen" },
        { title: "トキメキAbout you", translation: "Tokimeki About You" },
        { title: "GIRL'S TALK" },
        { title: "はなびえんちゃん。のテーマ", translation: "HANABIE-chan's Theme" },
    ],
},
{
    id: "love-ranbu",
    title: "LOVE♡乱舞",
    year: 2022,
    cover: "img/albums/loveRanbu.jpg",
    songs: [
        { title: "LOVE♡乱舞", translation: "Love Ranbu" },
    ],
    isSingle: true
},
{
    id: "odo", 
    title: "Odo",
    year: 2021,
    cover: "img/albums/odo.jpg",
    songs: [
        { title: "Odo" },
    ],
    isCover: true,
},
```

## Renaming or removing an album

- **Rename**: change `title` and/or `cover`. Don't change `id` unless you have a reason, `id` doesn't appear in the UI.
- **Remove**: delete the object. Nothing else references it.
- **Hide temporarily**: comment the object out with `/* ... */`.

## Fixing a song title

Edit the `title` (or `translation`) string on the appropriate song object. Be careful with punctuation: full-width vs. half-width characters (`（` vs. `(`), Japanese vs. English transliteration, and remix suffixes are all visible in the UI exactly as written.

## Duplicate Songs

Any songs that may appear on more than one album are de-duplicated so they will appear only once in the sort battle.
